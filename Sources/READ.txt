Hello, I see you have downloaded my template, congratulations, you found one of the best templates that is the REAL docs.js v14!

To complete the launch of your bot you must go to the file CONFIG.JS fill in this:

>- color: "Couleur_par_defaut_(#000000)",
>- colorTwitch: "#6441a5",
>- classicColor: "#FFFF00",
>- successColor: "#23dc3d",
>- warningColor: "#FFCC00",
>- errorColor: "#FF0000",
>- errorChannelInteraction: ""
>- token: "Token_Bot",
>- clientId: "ClientID_Bot"
>- mongoDB: "MongoDB_mongodb.com"

Left on TERMINAL at the top, left click on NEW TERMINAL or NEW TERMINAL (depending on language of vscode) do NPM I and wait for modules to install

This is a personal/public bot, which means you are the only one good for the owner to use. TOi (the owner) you can basically manage your computer files using this!

then after that, you can do NPM I to download the modules, in case you have a type MODULE NOT FOUND, check the name which is and you can faie NPM I (+ name of the module)

really in case of problem I authorize you to me DM on my discord!
explaining that you have a problem with my github D.js Version 14 template!
